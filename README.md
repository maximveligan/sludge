# Sludge: Rust+Lua Game Development, Batteries Included

***This crate is an extreme work in progress.***

Sludge is a collection of crates intended for game development in Rust with
a good collection of graphical, audio, and spatial primitives.

It currently uses miniquad for graphics context acquisition/rendering and
FMOD for audio, with support for the FMOD Studio API.

Everything is currently subject to change and very little is documented, as
the application we are currently building with this framework is very much
in flux. Use at your own risk.
